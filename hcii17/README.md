# HCII17

Here you will find all Java projects and instructions to conduct the experiment reported on 
_On Source Code Completion Assistants and the Need of a Context-Aware Approach_.

## Experiment overview
The experiment aims to collect and interpret usage information regarding two [Eclipse Neon 4.6.1](https://eclipse.org/neon/) code assistants that differ in the approaches used to filter and sort the list of possible completions. The first assistant is the longtime default option that ships with the Eclipse IDE, which filters completions according to the restrictions of code structure and method and variable visibility and scope, and sorts completions alphabetically and eventually according to the expected return type of an expression. The second assistant is the popular [Code Recommenders](https://eclipse.org/recommenders) that adds sorting features that rely upon predefined statistical usage models.

### The programming tasks
A number of programming tasks were designed to observe how professional software developers use code code assistants. All tasks can be found in project `programming-tasks` and they all considered the _fill-in-the-blanks_ approach seen below, in which software developers should replace invalid or incomplete statements according to a set of given instructions.
```java
public static String encode(byte[] input) {

    if (input == null || Array.getLength(input) == 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
    
    // ********************************************************************************
    // *
    // * Find a method to get a Base64 encoder
    // *
    // ********************************************************************************
    //
    // Once you find the right method, your statement will look like this:
    // (Please note that terms 'TYPE_OR_OBJECT' e 'METHOD' are to be replaced)
    //
    // Encoder encoder = TYPE_OR_OBJECT.METHOD;
    //
    // ********************************************************************************
    Encoder encoder = replaceMe_1; 

    ...
}
```
Each programming task is represented by two classes; the main class and the unit test class. The main classe has a clear goal, which can be found in the comments section. The unit tests class is designed to assert whether the task was indeed complete without providing too detailed feedback.

### Observing interactions and extending code assistants
To actually observe how software programmers interact with code asistants we created the `code-assistants` project. It adds a logging layer to the ordinary code assistants that ship with [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org) which records how many times a particular code assistant was invoked, how long it was active, the user input (if any) once the assistant was invoked and the eventual user choice.
In order to do so we define a few [extension points](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseExtensionPoint/article.html) of type `org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javaCompletionProposalComputer` (see reference documentation [here](http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fextension-points%2Forg_eclipse_jdt_ui_javaCompletionProposalComputer.html)) that extend the ordinary implementations (take a look at the [plugin.xml](/code-assistants/src/main/resources/plugin.xml) file to see how extension points are defined).

You can modify implementations at your own will, and since the `code-assistants` project was designed to build as an ordinary [Maven](https://www.maven.org) then all you have to do to build it is to run a simple
```sh
$ mvn package
```

Once a build is successful the resulting artifact will be an ordinary JAR file named `hcii17-code-assistants_1.0.0.jar` (or whatever version you are building).

*Please note that despite functional, these extensions access a few internal APIs and thus they do not follow Eclipse plugin coding guidelines.*

#### Enabling and disabling custom extensions
You can also modify the [plugin.xml](/code-assistants/src/main/resources/plugin.xml) file at your own discretion to enable or disable a particular extension. Use XMLs comment marks to do so and remember that since `plugin.xml` is embedded in the JAR file you should rebuild `code-assistants` at every change.
```xml
  <!-- This is an extension of the standard code completion assistant -->
  <extension point="org.eclipse.jdt.ui.javaCompletionProposalComputer"
      id="br.edu.fei.hcii17.codeassist.javaCompletionProposalComputer.std"
      name="[HCII17]: Standard">
    <javaCompletionProposalComputer
        activate="true"
        categoryId="br.edu.fei.hcii17.codeassist.std"
        class="br.edu.fei.hcii17.codeassist.StandardCompletionExtension">
    </javaCompletionProposalComputer>   
  </extension>
```

#### Log files
Log files are defined in the [logging.properties](/code-assistants/src/main/resources/logging.properties) file, which is also embedded in the JAR file. You can set the log location and log level, but a standard log file should like this:
```
...
INFO 2017-02-01 20:21:57,768 StandardCompletionExtension - Session started.
INFO 2017-02-01 20:21:57,783 StandardCompletionExtension - [Task01.java] - There are 37 completion proposals for 'if (from.'.
INFO 2017-02-01 20:22:01,929 StandardCompletionExtension - Session was active for 4 seconds.
...
```

## Running the experiment
Prepare a custom [Eclipse Neon 4.6.1](https://eclipse.org/neon/) distribution by placing the resulting JAR file of a `code-assistants` build in the `dropins` folder.

### Choosing the programming tasks
Select the programming tasks that are more suitable to your target audience and create a workspace. Assign to each participant a set pair of programming task and code assistant and mark task completion time.
Remember to configure code assistance properly, by ...

Remember that everytime you build `code-assistants` make sure you place the resulting JAR file in the `dropins` folder of your Eclipse distribution.

## Parsing log files
You can use the `log-parser` tool to interpret the results of your experiment. Take a look at the `MainApp` class and do the proper modifications.
